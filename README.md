#  ElderCareAI — Empowering Elderly Care with a Multi-Agent AI System

**ElderCareAI** is a modular, offline-capable multi-agent AI system designed to support elderly individuals living independently. It provides real-time health monitoring, fall detection, daily reminders, and AI-generated caregiver summaries. The solution is privacy-first, running entirely on local hardware with no internet dependency — ideal for edge devices or low-connectivity environments.

## Features

- **Health Monitor Agent**
  - Monitors vitals: Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Glucose, SpO₂
  - Detects abnormalities using a trained ML model
- **Safety Monitor Agent**
  - Detects fall risk from simulated sensor data
  - Uses an ML model trained on safety event datasets
- **Reminder Agent**
  - Sends voice/text reminders for medication & appointments
- **Communication Agent**
  - Generates natural language summaries using Ollama + LLaMA2
  - Designed for caregivers, family, and healthcare providers

##  Problem Statement

> As part of the hackathon challenge to build an AI-powered multi-agent system for elderly care, the goal was to develop a collaborative solution that detects health anomalies, fall risks, and helps elderly users manage their daily activities — all while keeping caregivers informed.

## Tech Stack

-  Python 3.9+
- scikit-learn, pandas, joblib (ML)
-  pyttsx3 (text-to-speech, optional)
-  [Ollama](https://ollama.com) + LLaMA2 (local LLM for summaries)
-  SQLite (for storing reminders)
- Metal GPU acceleration (Apple M2)
